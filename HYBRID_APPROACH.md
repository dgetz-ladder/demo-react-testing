# Hybrid Testing Approach

You asked: *"Can we snapshot HTML and render static HTML over the grid, with the vendor hosting Chrome for the initial snapshot?"*

**Answer: Yes!** Here are your options:

---

## Option 1: Static Build → Public URL → Grid Testing ⭐ RECOMMENDED

This is the cleanest hybrid approach - no tunnel needed!

### Workflow:

**Step 1: Build and deploy your app**
```bash
# Build static files
npm run build

# Deploy to any static host (pick one):
# - Netlify: npx netlify deploy --prod --dir=build
# - Vercel: npx vercel --prod
# - GitHub Pages: commit to gh-pages branch
# - S3: aws s3 sync build/ s3://your-bucket
```

**Step 2: Run grid tests against public URL**
```bash
# Set the public URL
export BASE_URL=https://your-app.netlify.app

# Run on vendor's Chrome with Percy
npm run e2e:selenium:grid percy single

# Or run on all browsers
npm run e2e:selenium:grid percy all
```

### What happens:
1. ✅ BrowserStack Chrome (cloud) loads your public URL
2. ✅ Percy captures DOM snapshot from that remote browser
3. ✅ Percy renders across all browsers on their servers
4. ✅ **No tunnel needed!** (Public URL accessible from anywhere)

### Benefits:
- ✅ No localhost/tunnel complexity
- ✅ Tests run on real vendor browsers
- ✅ Percy does cross-browser rendering
- ✅ Perfect for CI/CD
- ✅ Matches production environment

## Option 2: Percy Snapshot API (What You Might Already Want)

Percy already does a form of "hybrid" by default:

### Workflow:
```bash
# Just run Percy (local browser)
npm run e2e:selenium:screenshots:percy
```

### What happens:
1. ✅ Test runs in **your local Chrome** (fast)
2. ✅ Percy captures **DOM snapshot**
3. ✅ Percy uploads to cloud
4. ✅ Percy **renders** on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (their servers)
5. ✅ Percy compares all browser renderings

### Why this might be what you want:
- The **initial snapshot** can come from any browser (even local)
- Percy's **rendering engine** uses real browser engines in the cloud
- You get **cross-browser coverage** without running tests multiple times
- It's **vendor-hosted rendering** (Percy's infrastructure)

---

## Option 3: Percy on Automate with Public URL

Combine real browser execution with Percy:

### Workflow:
```bash
# Deploy app to public URL
export BASE_URL=https://your-app.netlify.app

# Run on BrowserStack grid with Percy
npm run e2e:selenium:grid percy all
```

### What happens:
1. ✅ BrowserStack Chrome runs test (real browser, cloud)
2. ✅ Percy captures during execution
3. ✅ Then repeat for Firefox, Safari, Edge...
4. ✅ Percy compares each browser's actual rendering

### Use when:
- You need to validate **actual browser behavior**
- Testing browser-specific JavaScript
- Need video/debugging from real browsers

## Comparison: Which Hybrid?

| Approach | Initial Browser | Cross-Browser | Tunnel Needed | Speed | Use Case |
|----------|----------------|---------------|---------------|-------|----------|
| **Static Build + Grid** | Vendor Chrome (cloud) | Percy renders | ❌ No | Fast | CI/CD, production validation |
| **Percy Snapshot API** | Local Chrome | Percy renders | ❌ No | Fastest | Daily dev, most cases |
| **Percy on Automate** | Vendor Chrome (cloud) | Run each browser | Depends* | Slow | Real browser validation |

\* No tunnel needed if using public URL

## Recommended Solution for You

Based on what you described, I recommend **Option 1: Static Build + Public URL**:

### Quick Setup:

1. **Add deploy script to package.json:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy:netlify": "npm run build && npx netlify deploy --prod --dir=build",
    "e2e:grid:prod": "export BASE_URL=https://your-app.netlify.app && npm run e2e:selenium:grid percy all"
  }
}
```

2. **Workflow:**
```bash
# Deploy once
npm run deploy:netlify

# Run grid tests (no tunnel!)
npm run e2e:grid:prod
```

### Benefits:
- ✅ Vendor hosts Chrome (BrowserStack)
- ✅ Percy renders across browsers
- ✅ Static HTML deployed (fast, reliable)
- ✅ No tunnel complexity
- ✅ Works perfectly in CI/CD

Would you like me to set this up? Or do you specifically need to test against localhost for some reason?
